            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 1</h4>
                    <p>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 2</h4>
                    <p>
                        Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add
                        sausage links and cook until browned and fat begins to
                        render, about 3 minutes per side. While they cook,
                        lightly pierce sausages in several places with the tip
                        of a sharp knife to release fats and juices. Remove from
                        the heat and place on a cutting board to cool slightly,
                        3 to 5 minutes.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 3</h4>
                    <p>
                        Cut cooled sausages into 2-inch slices; return to the
                        skillet along with any accumulated juices from the
                        cutting board.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 4</h4>
                    <p>
                        Cut two slashes down to the bone on the skin side of
                        each chicken thigh. Halve or quarter any large peppers.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 5</h4>
                    <p>
                        Place chicken and peppers into a large mixing bowl with
                        onions, sausage and juices, Italian herbs, salt, and
                        pepper. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon oil and mix
                        with your hands until all ingredients are coated in oil,
                        3 to 4 minutes.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 6</h4>
                    <p>
                        Transfer mixture to a large, heavy-duty roasting pan.
                        Evenly space chicken thighs with the skin facing up and
                        position potatoes near the top.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Step 7</h4>
                    <p>
                        Roast in the preheated oven until chicken is cooked
                        through and everything is caramelized, about 1 hour. An
                        instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should
                        read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Sprinkle with chopped
                        fresh Italian parsley.
                    </p>
